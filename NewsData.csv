2020-09-16,06:20:49,Our Correspondent,Jaleel could land in trouble for violating protocol in UAE dealings,"Thiruvananthapuram: K T Jaleel may find himself in trouble for dealing directly with the UAE consulate as a minister by violating established protocol. Although the government has been trying to defend him saying he has only been questioned by the ED, investigative agencies suspect smuggling could have happened using his dealings as a cover. Minister Jaleel’s intervention to distribute the religious texts that arrived through the Consulate and his communications with Swapna Suresh and the Consul General were in violation of a circular issued by the General Administration Department. The circular issued by the protocol section of the General Administration Department warned against such direct transactions. Jaleel has justified his dealings saying he had spoken to Swapna in her capacity as a Consulate employee. But, Swapna had left the Consulate and she was working in the Space Park under the state government. The minister will, therefore, have to explain what was the purpose of his phone conversations with Swapna. There are indications that the minister has not followed official procedures in using government facilities to distribute the religious texts that came via the diplomatic channel. The Enforcement Directorate is now investigating whether the gold that reached Thiruvananthapuram was smuggled to other districts along with the packages containing the religious texts. The minister’s questioning was as part of this investigation. The CPM has argued that Jaleel was not questioned as a minister and that is why he used a private vehicle to go to the ED office. That is also the reason why the interrogation notice was delivered to his house in Valanchery, the CPM said. However, sources in the Enforcement Directorate said the notice was delivered at his home because the minister was continuously in quarantine. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday said Minister K T Jaleel, who had appeared before the Enforcement Directorate in an alleged FCRA violation case, had committed no wrong and the Congress, the Muslim League and BJP were targeting him due to his ""political stand.""",Manorama,https://www.onmanorama.com/news/kerala/2020/09/16/kt-jaleel-uae-dealings-protocol-violation.html
2020-09-16,08:15:57,RS Santhoshkumar,Kannada film's star couple summoned for questioning in drugs case,"Bengaluru: Star couple Diganth Manchale and Aindrita Ray have been issued notice to appear for questioning in the Kannada film drugs racket case. This is the first time that an actor is being suspected in the case in which actresses’ Ragini Dwivedi and Sanjjanaa Galrani have already been arrested. It is learnt that investigators have obtained evidence that the couple had attended parties organised by the arrested accused Viren Khanna, Ravi Shankar and Rahul Shetty. There are indications that Aindrita participated in a party organised at a gambling den in Sri Lanka by Shaikh Faziullah, an accused in the case. The Bengaluru Central Crime Branch (CCB) is looking for Faziullah. Aindrita made her film debut in 2006 with ‘Jackpot’. She then co-starred with Diganth in ‘Meravanige’ in 2008. The two got married in 2018. Meanwhile, the Central Crime Branch police raided the resort of Aditya Alva, a real estate businessman and the sixth accused in the case. Aditya, the son of former Janata Dal leader and former Karnataka minister late Jeevaraj Alva and the brother-in-law of Bollywood actor Vivek Oberoi, is reportedly in hiding in Mumbai. Investigators have found out that Aditya organised drug parties on weekends at his resort, which also includes his bungalow. Foreigners and celebrities took part in the parties, they said. Aditya is said to have a close friendship with Viren Khanna, the celebrity organiser of drug parties. The actress was taken to Parappana Agrahara Central Jail around 7:30pm on Monday after she was remanded in the drugs case. She was admitted to the prison hospital due to low blood sugar. Ragini was arrested on September 4. Actress Sanjana Galrani, who is in the custody of the CCB, was found to have changed the SIMs in her mobile phone. Her custody will end on Wednesday.",Manorama,https://www.onmanorama.com/news/nation/2020/09/16/kannada-film-stars-couple-questioning-drugs-case.html
2020-09-16,06:01:38,Achu Oommen,Oommen Chandy’s daughter talks about the man behind the politician,"Former Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy's daughter Achu Oommen writes about the man behind the politician. I was often referred to as my father's advocate during my childhood years. If he had not become a politician, I think he would have been a priest. My Appa is a spiritual person. Even when he came under attack in the solar scam, he maintained his decorum. He was respectful even when he responded to opponents and did not even once make any remark against their families. Our family was really disheartened to note that a person, who had led an unblemished public life for so long, was mercilessly persecuted after some people raised allegations. But Appa was the one who consoled us then. UN Award Appa interacted with the public, and addressed the grievances of tens and thousands of people during the mass contact programme. He did not even take a break during those 20 hours and the United Nations lauded his efforts. I was extremely happy when he got the UN Award. But there were people who criticised this as well. But the practice that has been prevalent in our country for years cannot be changed overnight. Everyone celebrated the arrival of Kochi Metro. But I did not hear anyone mention my father's vision and willpower that made it a possibility. He was not even extended the courtesy of an invite. But Appa did not complain and travelled in the Metro with the other passengers the next day. My respect and affection for him only grew when I saw this. A painful memory from Davos One of my bitter memories is from Davos in Switzerland. I was working with the Standard Chartered bank then. When my father came to Davos to take part in the World Economic Forum, I was also present. Appa was wearing an old pair of shoes, which were not suitable to walk in the snow. There were winter boots in the kit given by the event organisers. Neither me nor the secretaries checked the kit. Appa slipped and fell down, fracturing his thigh bone. A part of the bone had to be removed during the surgery. And his leg became slightly shorter and he walks with a limp because of this now. Even though it has been years since that incident, he has not asked me or others about the boots. I went with my father to New York last year. He was not familiar with the equipment or cupboards in the room. I told him specifically to call me if he needed something. As I was tired, I slept till 7am the next day. I woke up to find that Appa had bathed and was dressed up. He had woken up at 2am. Though he wanted to have his morning tea, he waited till I woke up. Treats everyone the same I will never forget the advice Appa gave me when I decided to contest in election at the Mar Ivanios College in Thiruvananthapuram years ago. (CPM state secretary) Kodiyeri Balakrishnan's son Binoy Kodiyeri was the opponent. ""Don't expect any help from me. Don't think you can get anything you want just because you are my daughter,” he said. He never differentiated between us and his siblings' children. His niece Suma chechi has imbibed almost all of his qualities. And he was heartbroken when his nephew Sumod died. Biggest strengths…. Wisdom, hard work and the ability to resolve issues are his biggest strengths. But I also think that his genteel approach to people and attaching more importance to other people's opinions than his own are his weaknesses. His insistence against doing anything that could tarnish his public image is also a weak spot. Plus, he does not behave rudely with anyone. Political prowess and popular support have been his mainstay. ‘Sir died, we are saved’ Appa also remembers funny anecdotes and often shares such stories with us. Once he was invited as the chief guest at the annual day function of his school. Congress leader J G Palakkalody was also present for the event in Kottayam. Just before the event started, Palakkalody informed him that a former school principal had died. Then, Appa announced that the event had been postponed. As he was about to leave, Palakkalody came rushing to him and said, ""There has been some mistake. That headmaster has not died."" Appa was saddened that he had announced the demise of a person, who was very much alive. The crowd of attendees had also dispersed. After some time, Palakkalody came up to him again and said, ""Sir died. We are saved...""

2020-09-16,08:21:18,PTI,India walks out of SCO meet after Pak representative projects 'fictitious map',"New Delhi: India on Tuesday walked out of a meeting of the national security advisors of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) member countries in protest after the Pakistani representative used a ""fictitious"" map showing Indian territories as part of Pakistan. ""This was in blatant disregard to the advisory by the host against it and in violation of the norms of the meeting. After consultation with the host, the Indian side left the meeting in protest at that juncture,"" External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said. The virtual meeting was chaired by Russia. ""As was to be expected, Pakistan then went on to present a misleading view of this meeting,"" Srivastava said responding to a query on the issue. Government sources said the Pakistani action was ""blatant violation"" of the SCO charter and against all its established norms of safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of SCO member states. They said the Indian side issued its strong objection to the use of the illegal map by Pakistan and even the Russian side tried very hard to persuade the Pakistani representative not to do so. Pakistan was represented at the meet by Moeed W Yusuf, Special Assistant to the prime minister on national security. Nikolai Patrushev, the Secretary of the National Security Council of Russia, conveyed that he was personally very grateful to Indian NSA Ajit Doval for attending the meet, the sources said. They said Russia does not support what Pakistan has done and hopes that Pakistan's ""provocative"" act will not affect India's participation in SCO and not cast any shadow on Patrushev's warm personal relationship with the Indian NSA for whom he said he has the ""highest regard"". Both India and Pakistan are members of the SCO, an influential regional grouping. The SCO, seen as a counterweight to NATO, has emerged as one of the largest trans-regional international organisations which accounts for almost 44 per cent of the world population stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Indian Ocean and from the Pacific Ocean to the Baltic Sea.",Manorama,https://www.onmanorama.com/news/nation/2020/09/16/india-walks-out-of-sco-meet-after-pak-representative-projects-fi.html
2020-09-16,09:08:31,PTI,Serum Institute gets DCGI nod to resume clinical trial of Oxford COVID-19 vaccine,"New Delhi: Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) Dr V G Somani on Tuesday gave permission to Serum Institute of India to resume clinical trial of the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine candidate in the country while revoking its earlier order of suspending any new recruitment for phase two and three trial. The DCGI, however, put certain conditions like taking extra care during screening, providing additional information in informed consent and close monitoring for adverse events during follow-up of the study which have to be ""scrupulously"" followed by Serum Institute of India (SII). SII has also been asked to submit to the DCGI's office details of medication used in accordance with the protocol for management of adverse events. The DCGI had on September 11 directed Serum Institute of India to suspend any new recruitment in the phase two and three clinical trial of the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine candidate till further orders in the backdrop of pharma giant AstraZeneca pausing the clinical trials in other countries because of ''an unexplained illness'' in a participant in the study. On Saturday, British-Swedish biopharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford said clinical trials for their coronavirus vaccine have resumed in the UK after the Medicines Health Regulatory Authority's (MHRA) confirmed that the trials were safe. SII, which has partnered with AstraZeneca for manufacturing the vaccine candidate for COVID-19, on Tuesday submitted the recommendations of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), UK and DSMB, India, and requested for permission to restart enrolment in the clinical trial. According to Tuesday's order issued by DCGI, the DSMB, UK, recommended that the investigators recommence all immunization in their clinical trials subject to certain conditions. DSMB, India, also has recommended to continue the study and enroll the remaining participants in the clinical trial as per protocol subject to certain conditions. According to the order, SII has submitted revised participant information sheet, revised informed consent form and additional safety monitoring plan for the evolved participants. The Pune-based firm has also submitted a summary of safety follow up of seven days post first vaccination, stating that no serious adverse events were experienced by any of the subjects till the date of the reporting, and the reported adverse events were stated to be mild, resolved on their own and did not have any sequale. ""In view of the above, I Dr V G Somani, Drugs Controller General of India, Central Licensing Authority, after careful examination of your reply and the recommendations of the DSMB in India and in UK revoke herewith the order dated September 11 issued under Rule 30 of the New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019. ""You may recommence the clinical trial as recommended by DSMB, India, as per already approved protocol and the provisions laid down under the New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules, 2019, subject to the conditions mentioned,"" the order said.",Manorama,https://www.onmanorama.com/news/nation/2020/09/16/serum-institute-gets-dcgi-nod-to-resume-clinical-trial-of-oxford.html
2020-09-16,07:55:35,Anantha Krishnan M,Scanner app from IIT Bombay students can also read to you,"Bengaluru: Two self-motivated civil engineering students from IIT Bombay have developed a mobile application that can scan PDFs with an AI-based (artificial intelligence) dictionary and offers a narration option. Great news — especially for those from a non-English background. AIRScanner, a free-to-download document-scanning app is a passionate response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ call. Speaking to Onmanorama, AIRScanner developers Kavin Agrawal and Rohit Kumar Chaudhary hoped that their efforts will now inspire youngsters to launch desi apps. AIRScanner was released on August 15 and aims to end the over-dependence on Chinese apps, of which many have been already banned by the Indian government. The app is available on PlayStore for free download. AIRScanner stands for Artificial Intelligence-based Reading and Scanning. It is a product of two different concepts: AI reading assistant and document scanner. “We started working on this app in June this year. With time, our primary motive edged towards making probably India's best document scanning app with AI technology,” said Kavin. On the challenges faced while developing the app, Kavin, a native of Jalore in Rajasthan, said that start-up journeys are never smooth, and this one was no exception. “We had to be all-rounders in order to establish a stable baseline for our first product (AIRScanner). We did everything ranging from back-end to front-end (UI), web development to marketing, designing posters to creating videos.” He said the development work of the app hasn’t cost them anything except three months of consistent hard work and dedication. “We have not tried for funding yet, but in the near future we will be seeking funds,” said Kavin, who loves reading science novels and is an avid gamer. Self-inspired The duo said they were self-inspired and while developing the app, only thought of the reading problem that a person with a non-English background faced. “AI reading assistant is a solution which makes reading super easy with AI dictionary. And narrator is an added feature of this app. While we were developing the reading assistant, the government initiated the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan, followed by a ban on 59 Chinese apps, including CamScanner. It motivated us to integrate a document scanner in our app,” said Rohit, who hails from Jamshedpur in Jharkhand. He said the entire project was carried out independently by them from their homes during the lockdown period. “We didn’t have any guide. Since we hail from a reputed university, we got our app properly vetted by internal committee members of IIT Bombay before launching it,” said Rohit, a sci-fi movie addict who loves trekking. The app doesn’t show up advertisements, and PDF documents are generated quickly without any watermark. He said IIT Bombay has been very supportive of their innovation. “As soon as we reached out to IIT Bombay, they had an internal committee test our app — both to check its security and provide necessary feedback on it. They were the ones to give the initial push,” said Rohit. Advanced Version Having accomplished the roll-out of the first version of AIRScanner, the duo now wants to make the app better and more stable. “We aim to introduce more innovative features. The unique AI dictionary and the narrator have a lot of scope for improvement. We are working consistently and planning to grow the team as well to make our EdTech product world-class and globally renowned for making reading (in all major languages) easy,” said Kavin. So what took two civil engineering students on to the technology track? “At IIT Bombay, it’s quite normal that people studying ‘X’ find interest in ‘Y’ and later pursue that field. And thankfully, our institute allows us good flexibility to take courses and projects in different departments. We are friends since our second year, and we have done projects and hackathons together. We are a team and connect well,” said Rohit. The response to the app has been encouraging in the first few weeks, with thousands of downloads and a decent rating of 4.7 from users. According to the reviews, majority liked the AI reading assistant feature. The app does not collect user information and guarantees complete security. “After graduation, we have plans to launch more EdTech products based on AI to make learning easy and interactive, under the startup company named Hind AI Labs. We are motivated by the Aatmanirbhar Bharat call. As we speak, our market is flooded with non-Indian products. We want to support the ‘Make in India’ movement by creating products in the field of IT and education,” said Kavin.

2020-09-15,21:56:16,Onmanorama Staff,"Pinarayi Vijayan claims he's non-corruptible, calls Surendran 'mentally unstable'","Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Tuesday that the opposition was resorting to mere gossip to paint him and his family as corrupt because they were finding the non-corrupt image of his government hard to tolerate. Vijayan was responding to the BJP state president K Surendran's allegation that more details about the commission paid as part of Life Mission deals would come to light if the chief minister's daughter was interrogated. Initially, it looked like the chief minister was in a mood to ignore Surendran's charge when he was told about it by reporters during his COVD briefing in Thiruvananthapuram. ""It will be news even if I don't reply to this. Let it be,"" he said. But the chief minister was provoked when he was told that the charge was made by the state president of a party that is ruling India. ""It is they (BJP) who should realise that such mentally unstable person was occupying an important position,"" he said. ""Anyone with a normal state of mind can never say what he had said,"" he added. Though he questioned Surendran's sanity, the chief minister, even after repeated posers, did not say whether he would move legally against the BJP leader. In fact, it was a comment by the chief minister that prompted reporters to ask him about the possibility of a legal recourse. ""There are many things I would like to tell him (Surendran), but not through a press conference,"" he said. The chief minister was unwilling to elaborate how he would do this but when reporters wanted to move to another issue, the chief minister insisted they stayed with Surendran. ""You just can't leave this issue,"" the chief minister kept repeating these words, his voice rising over a reporter's, and then he admonished the media for functioning as Surendran's ""megaphone"". He wanted to know on what basis Surendran was making such charges. When he was again asked why he was not approaching the court, Vijayan had a word of advice for the media. ""You should be able to see such things as mere gossip. Do you have any facts before you."" According to the chief minister, these charges were part of attempts to mire the LDF government in controversies. ""Our political foes are just not able to tolerate the fact that the LDF government was untouched by corruption. So they want to establish that ours is a hive of corruption,"" he said. Vijayan then went down memory lane and recalled incidents that would demonstrate that he had led a life of high integrity unlike his political enemies. He spoke of a time decades ago when the Congress was in power and how honestly and transparently he had conducted recruitments as the president of Kannur District Cooperative Bank. A government-appointed observer had secured money from a candidate to get her selected. ""When I knew of it I called up her parents and told them not to give any money to anyone as their daughter would get the job only if she had the merit,"" Vijayan said. The girl got selected by merit but Vijayan said he later came to know that the family still had to give the money promised to the middleman. The chief minister said he recalled the incident to show the habit with which he had grown up. ""This habit was a stand against corruption. That is why we have never been touched by corruption. That is also why I could sit before you and talk with my head held high even after so many allegations have been hurled against me,"" Vijayan said. He said he was not the kind of person to whom anyone can approach with a bribe. ""Just because anyone says something will not make me or my children or my family members corrupt,"" he said.",Manorama,https://www.onmanorama.com/news/kerala/2020/09/15/pinarayi-vijayan-slams-k-surendran-allegations-calls-it-gossip.html
2020-09-15,23:41:13,AP via PTI,"UAE and Bahrain sign US-brokered deals with Israel, breaking longtime taboo","Washington: Declaring the dawn of a new Middle East, President Donald Trump on Tuesday presided over the signing of historic diplomatic pacts between Israel and two Gulf Arab nations that he hopes will lead to a new order in the Mideast and cast him as a peacemaker at the height of his reelection campaign. Hundreds of people amassed on the sun-washed South Lawn to witness the signing of agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. The bilateral agreements formalize the normalization of the Jewish state's already thawing relations with the two Arab nations in line with their common opposition to Iran and its aggression in the region. ""We're here this afternoon to change the course of history, Trump said from a balcony overlooking the South Lawn. After decades of division and conflict, we mark the dawn of a new Middle East. The agreements do not address the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While the UAE, Bahrain and other Arab countries support the Palestinians, the Trump administration has persuaded the two countries not to let that conflict keep them from having normal relations with Israel. Trump's political backers are looking for the agreements to boost his standing as a statesman with just seven weeks to go before Election Day. Until now, foreign policy has not had a major role in a campaign dominated by the coronavirus, racial issues and the economy. The pandemic was in the backdrop of the White House ceremony, where there was no social distancing and most guests didn't wear masks. The agreements won't end active wars, but supporters believe they could pave the way for a broader Arab-Israeli rapprochement after decades of enmity and only two previous peace deals. Sceptics, including many longtime Mideast analysts and former officials, have expressed doubts about their impact and lamented that they ignore the Palestinians, who have rejected them as a stab in the back by fellow Arabs. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel has only suspended its plans to annex West Bank settlements. Yet even the harshest critics have allowed that the agreements could usher in a major shift in the region should other Arab nations, particularly Saudi Arabia, follow suit, with implications for Iran, Syria and Lebanon. Other Arab countries believed to be close to recognizing Israel include Oman, Sudan and Morocco. ""We are very down the road with about five different countries, Trump told reporters before the ceremony. In addition to the bilateral agreements signed by Israel, the UAE and Bahrain, all three are signing a document dubbed the Abraham Accords after the patriarch of the world's three major monotheistic religions. The Palestinians have not embraced the US vision. Palestinian activists held small demonstrations on Tuesday in the West Bank and in Gaza, where they trampled and set fire to pictures of Trump, Netanyahu and the leaders of the UAE and Bahrain. A poll released on Tuesday found that 86 per cent of Palestinians believe the normalization agreement with the UAE serves only Israel's interests and not their own. The poll, carried out by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, was carried out Sept. 9-12 and surveyed 1,270 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Even in Israel, where the accords have received widespread acclaim, there is concern they might result in US sales of sophisticated weaponry to the UAE and Bahrain, thus potentially upsetting Israel's qualitative military edge in the region. They're very wealthy countries for the most part ... some are extraordinary, like UAE, Trump told Fox &amp; Friends in an interview before the ceremony. And they would like to buy some fighter jets and I personally would have no problem with it. Meanwhile, a politically vulnerable Netanyahu is facing questions about appearing at such a large event just days after he announced a new nationwide lockdown to fight a surge in coronavirus cases that will impose severe restrictions on movement and gatherings. And while the UAE and Bahrain have a history of suppressing dissent and critical public opinion, there have been indications that the agreements are not nearly as popular or well-received as in Israel. Neither country sent its head of state or government to sign the deals with Netanyahu. Bahrain's largest Shiite-dominated opposition group, Al-Wefaq, which the government ordered dissolved in 2016 amid a yearslong crackdown on dissent, said there is widespread rejection of normalization. Al-Wefaq said in a statement that it joins other Bahrainis who reject the agreement to normalize ties with the Zionist entity and criticized the government for crushing the public's ability to express opinions to obscure the extent of discontent at normalization. The ceremony follows months of intricate diplomacy headed by Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, and the president's envoy for international negotiations, Avi Berkowitz. On August 13, the Israel-UAE deal was announced. That was followed by the first direct commercial flight between the countries, and then the Sept. 11 announcement of the Bahrain-Israel agreement.",Manorama,https://www.onmanorama.com/news/world/2020/09/15/us-donald-trump-peace-deal-uae-bahrain-israel.html
2020-09-15,20:19:54,Our Correspondent,"NIA recovers 4,000 GB of digital data from 5 accused in gold smuggling case","Kochi: The investigation team has recovered 4,000 GB of digital information from five of the accused in the gold smuggling case, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has told the court. The agency found 2,000 GB of information while checking the phones and laptops of Swapna Suresh and Sandeep Nair, two of the key accused in the case, and another 2,000 GB from the devices of three other accused, it said. This also includes the information obtained by retrieving the WhatsApp and Telegram messages of the accused. The investigation team has obtained crucial evidence against the accused from the digital data, the NIA told the court. The NIA court had issued warrants against the five, directing that they be produced before it. The court order came on a request from the NIA for custody of the five accused for five days for questioning. However, the NIA produced only three of them on Tuesday. Swapna Suresh and Mohammad Anwar were not brought to the court. Swapna Suresh has been admitted to the Thrissur Medical College Hospital for an angiogram as she has been constantly complaining of chest pain. That is why she could not be produced, the NIA told the court. Mohammad Anwar could not be produced due to a technical error in the court documents, the NIA said. Sandeep Nair, Mohammad Shafi and Mohammad Ali were produced in court. The court remanded them in the custody of the NIA for questioning. It has allowed the agency to question them till Friday. Swapna will be produced in court after the details of her treatment become clear and Mohammad Anwar will be produced soon. The court is likely to give their custody also to the NIA for questioning. No serious health problems, both Swapna and Ramees back in jail Gold smuggling accused Swapna Suresh and K T Ramees, who were admitted to the Thrissur Medical College Hospital after they complained of chest pain and stomach ache, respectively, have been shifted back to jail. The two were discharged from the hospital on the basis of an assessment by the medical board that they did not have any serious health problems. Swapna underwent an angiogram, while Ramees was subjected to an endoscopy. Swapna's family had reached the hospital, but they could not see her. Swapna was taken to hospital around 6:30pm on Sunday after she said she had pain in the chest. Half-an-hour later, Ramees was also moved to the hospital after he complained of stomach ache. Swapna had only been discharged on Saturday after six days in hospital after she had complained of chest pain once before. She was again admitted in less than a day after the medical board had certified that she had no significant health problems, giving rise to allegations that there was something suspicious about it. The jail department has sought an explanation from the superintendent of the women's prison where Swapna is lodged and the superintendent of the high-security prison where Ramees is being held in custody.",Manorama,https://www.onmanorama.com/news/kerala/2020/09/15/nia-evidence-gold-smuggling-case-swapna-suresh.html
2020-09-16,08:51:11,PTI,"SC restrains Sudarshan TV from telecasting programme, says it apparently vilifies Muslims","New Delhi: The Supreme Court Tuesday restrained Sudarshan TV from telecasting its episodes of 'Bindas Bol' programme for two days on alleged infiltration of Muslims in civil services, saying the intent of aired episodes prima facie appears to vilify the community. The top court, which on August 28 had desisted from imposing a pre-broadcast interim stay on airing of episodes, asked the channel not to show tonight and on Wednesday saying there has been a change of circumstances, at least, prima facie, on the basis of the record with regard to the content, intent of the programs. At this stage, prima facie, it does appear to the Court that the intent, object and purpose of the episodes which have been telecast is to vilify the Muslim community. An insidious attempt has been made to insinuate that the community is involved in a conspiracy to infiltrate the civil services, a bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud said in the order. Terming India as a melting pot of civilizations, cultures, religions and languages, the bench said that any attempt to vilify a religious community must be viewed with grave disfavour by this Court as the custodian of constitutional values and its duty to enforce constitutional values demands nothing less. The bench, also comprising Justices Indu Malhotra and K M Joseph, did not agree to the contention of senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for the channel, that the telecast should not be banned keeping in mind the aspect of freedom of press and moreover, there was no change in circumstances from the day it had refused to impose a pre-telecast ban. On the basis of what has been aired, we are of the view that it will be necessary to interdict any further telecast. Consequently, we direct that pending further orders of this Court, the fifth respondent shall stand injuncted from making any further telecast in continuation of or similar to the episodes which were telecast on 11, 12, 13 and 14 September, 2020 either under the same or any other title or caption, it said in the order while fixing the case for hearing on September 17. The bench suggested that a committee of apolitical experts of distinguished citizens or former judges may be appointed to help in self-regulating the electronic media specially. We are of the opinion that we may appoint a committee of five distinguished citizens who can come up with certain standards for the electronic media. We don't want any politically divisive nature and we need members who are of commendable stature, it observed during the hearing conducted through video conferencing. The court took note of alleged false statements made in the episodes and said it has been reported that the upper age limit for Hindus in the civil services examination is 32 years and the age limit for Muslims is 35 years and while six attempts are for Hindus to appear in the civil services examination, Muslims are entitled to nine attempts. Several statements in the episodes, which have been drawn to the attention of the Court are not just palpably erroneous but have been made in wanton disregard of the truth. There is no relaxation either in the age limit or in the number of attempts available to the Muslim community in the civil services. The drift, tenor and content of the episodes is to bring the community into public hatred and disrepute, it noted. Referring to rules of the Cable and Television Networks (Regulation), it said that the court was duty bound to ensure compliance with the salutary principles of the Programme Code which provided that no programme should be carried containing attack on religions or communities or visuals or words contemptuous of religious groups or which promote communal attitudes. Under Rule 6(1)(d), the Programme Code should not, inter alia, contain anything which is defamatory, false or reflective of half - truths and suggestive innuendos, it said. The bench also allowed the intervention application of former bureaucrats who wanted to support petitioner Firoz Iqbal Khan who is seeking injunction on the broadcast of the programme on the ground that they formed part of hate speech. Divan, however, said the channel considered it as an investigative story on national security and the programme has 10 episodes. There is whole regime of consequences if the channel has done any wrong in the programme, but I feel that there is no deviation from Broadcasting rules, he said Referring to an earlier order of the apex court in the matter, Divan argued that it was rightly said that there cannot be a pre-telecast ban on the programme. We will sit the day after tomorrow and in the meantime, you don't broadcast the episode today, the bench suggested during the hearing. Divan opposed it and said, this is a case of foreign funding and I must say that if the telecast is stalled then I will raise the issue of press freedom. The bench observed that regulating the internet is very difficult but there is a need to regulate the electronic media now. Most of the channels are running for the TRPs, the bench observed. There should be some kind of self-regulation in the media, the apex court said while raising questions over the programme. Look at this programme, how rabid is this programme that one community is entering into civil services, the bench observed. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the top court that freedom of journalists is supreme and it would be disastrous for any democracy to control the press.",Manorama,https://www.onmanorama.com/news/nation/2020/09/16/-sc-restrains-sudarshan-tv-from-telecasting-programme-says-it-ap.html
2020-09-15,21:05:02,Our Correspondent,Ramsi suicide case: Lakshmi Pramod seeks anticipatory bail,"Kollam: Television serial actress Lakshmi Pramod has moved an anticipatory bail petition before a Kollam court in connection with the suicide of Ramsi, a young woman belonging to Kottiyam in the district. Ramsi (24) had resorted to the extreme step after a youth named Harris had backtracked from marrying her. Lakshmi is the wife of Harris’s elder brother. Ramsi and Lakshmi were earlier close and had even made some TikTok videos together. The messages and conversations between the two would prove crucial evidence in the case, according to the police. Officials also said that Lakshmi would be made an accused in the case. Meanwhile, Lakshmi and all the other accused, except Harris, are now absconding. The actress and her husband were questioned by the police last week. There were reports that Lakshmi would be probed in the case related to the forging of a marriage certificate to carry out an abortion on Ramsi when she was three months pregnant. It was on September 3 that Ramsi took her own life. She and Harris were in a relationship for several years and their wedding too was fixed. However, Harris backtracked from marriage reportedly after receiving a proposal from a girl belonging to an affluent family and unable to bear the loss, Ramsi killed herself. Crime Branch probe sought
 Meanwhile, alleging that the local police officials are adopting a soft approach towards the accused, Ramsi’s family has demanded a Crime Branch probe in the case. The accused have been charged with weak sections of the Indian Penal Code, Ramsi’s relatives pointed out.
 Ramsi’s father Rahim also told ‘Manorama Online’ that he would approach the Chief Minister seeking a high-level enquiry into his daughter’s death. “There is an attempt to end the investigation with the arrest of Harris, the main accused. Till now, the local police have only arrested one person. The others involved, including Lakshmi, were summoned for questioning just once,” said Rahim. He also alleged that there was a move to save Lakshmi utilizing top connections. “The police claim that the actress is absconding and are making the clichéd statement that the evidence is being collected,” he added. “Moreover, the probe is being deliberately delayed under the ruse that two police officers are in quarantine. That nobody except Harris has been arrested despite the availability of sufficient proof shows that the investigation is heading in the wrong direction,” said Ramsi’s father. He sought the immediate arrest of Harris’s mother, who had mentally harassed Ramsi and was an accomplice in cheating the young woman of her money and jewellery. She had also allegedly forced Ramsi to carry out an abortion. At the same time, Rahim said that he would fight until his daughter received justice.",Manorama,https://www.onmanorama.com/news/kerala/2020/09/15/ramsi-suicide-case-lakshmi-pramod-seeks-anticipatory-bail.html
2020-09-15,21:37:00,Reuters,"Amid stand-off, India doubles budget for roads and bridges on China border","New Delhi: India has doubled the budget for vital roads and bridges along the undemarcated border with China in recent years in response to Beijing's rapid infrastructure development on its side, the Indian defence minister said on Tuesday. Troops of the two countries are locked in their most serious face-offs for years along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) or informal border in the western Himalayas, raising fears of a broader conflict. One of the reasons for the tensions has been India's recent construction of roads and airfields near the border in the Ladakh region bordering Tibet, the Chinese side has said. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh told parliament that China had been building up its infrastructure in the remote mountains for decades and the government was trying to close the gap. ""Our government too has stepped up the budget for border infrastructure development to about double the previous levels. As a result, more roads and bridges have been completed in the border areas,"" he said. He provided no figure. Military officials say the development of roads and airfields on both sides of the border has also helped troops mobilise quickly in large numbers and in close proximity at some points in the Ladakh area. Singh said Indian and Chinese troops have had face-offs on the unsettled border in the past, but the scale of deployment of troops and the number of disputed areas was much more than the past. ""As of now, the Chinese side has mobilized a large number of troops and armaments along the LAC as well as in the depth areas,"" he said, listing Gogra, Kongka La and the north and south banks of the Pangong lake as ""friction points."" ""In response to China’s actions, our armed forces have also made appropriate counter deployments in these areas to ensure that India’s security interests are fully protected,"" he said to the thumping of desks in parliament.",Manorama,https://www.onmanorama.com/news/nation/2020/09/15/india-china-border-strife-line-of-actual-control-rajnath-singh.html
2020-09-16,08:45:11,IANS,KKR have the firepower to go all the way,"Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will look to the make the most of an efficient leadership group coupled with world-class performers in their bid to bounce back after the two-time champions flattered to deceive last season, crashing out of the play-off zone for the first time since 2015.

As part of the preparations for the 13th edition, beginning in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on September 19, KKR snapped up star Australian seamer Pat Cummins for a record Rs.15.5 crore, the most expensive overseas purchase in the history of the IPL. But it was the signing of England's ODI World Cup-winning skipper Eoin Morgan that further added to their arsenal, not only for the left-hander's batting exploits but also his skills as a leader, besides captain Dinesh Karthik.

Karthik was not at his best donning the skipper's hat last time as the team finished fifth. The wicket-keeper-batsman's decisions were frowned upon by sceptics and the team suffered from inconsistency. KKR's mentor David Hussey said at a recent media interaction from Abu Dhabi that Morgan would be a great ally to Karthik and his calm demeanour can help the team win matches. ""He is a World Cup-winning captain. He has captained England for a long time -- classy player. He will be a great ally for Dinesh Karthik,"" former Australia and KKR batsman Hussey said.

""Maybe fielding in the ring and talking to the bowlers while our captain's behind the stumps, keeping wickets. He is also a very cool calm and collected person so...he will be very handy in the middle order controlling things with our captain as well.""

Batting wise, KKR were over reliant on Andre Russell with the big-hitting West Indies all-rounder scoring 510 runs in 13 innings despite batting lower down the order, something which was not to his liking.

This time the middle order will get the much needed support from Morgan besides Karthik and Nitish Rana. The hugely talented Shubman Gill will be expected to open the batting along with Sunil Narine who had a strike-rate of 150-plus last time opening the batting. For firepower there is dashing England opener Tom Banton who can bat anywhere as seen in the England-Australia T20 series recently.

KKR's bowling was abysmal last season with Russell topping the list of wicket-takers with 11 scalps. The spin trio comprising Sunil Narine, Kuldeep Yadav and Piyush Chawla failed miserably, though the West Indian had found some form at the back end of the league stage and finished with 10 wickets in 12 games with an economy rate of 7.82.

Lockie Ferguson, Prasidh Krishna and Harry Gurney were expected to be the X-factor but could not produce the spark as they were treated with disdain by the opponent batters.

In contrast, Kerala pacer Sandeep Warrier, who was a late replacement of injured seamer Kamlesh Nagarkoti, impressed with his control and accuracy with the new ball in the three games he played.

This time, KKR will have Cummins to bank on, besides a much improved Ferguson and the likes of Warrier and Prasidh Krishna for backup. KKR will also have the services of USA fast bowler Ali Khan who has replaced Gurney.

Strengths

KKR's strength will be the balance in all departments. From a leadership point of view, Morgan and Cummins will be there to assist Karthik. There is firepower and talent across the batting and bowling arsenal and on a given day, KKR has match-winners who can blow any opposition away.

Weaknesses

KKR can tread an inconsistent path and at times their decision making leaves much to be desired. Karthik drew flak for his leadership last season and although he has Morgan by his side, the seasoned campaigner would do well to be more flexible this time and cut the coat according to the cloth. The spinners floundered last time and if the same happens this season, there could be pressure on Cummins and Co. to deliver in warm conditions where they need to manage their workload.

Squad: Andre Russell, Dinesh Karthik (capt & wk), Ali Khan, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Kuldeep Yadav, Lockie Ferguson, Nitish Rana, Prasidh Krishna, Rinku Singh, Sandeep Warrier, Shivam Mavi, Shubman Gill, Siddhesh Lad, Sunil Narine, Pat Cummins, Eoin Morgan, Varun Chakravarthy, Tom Banton, Rahul Tripathi, Chris Green, M Siddharth, Praveen Tambe, Nikhil Naik (wk).

2020-09-15,20:56:39,Onmanorama Staff,"Kerala records 3,215 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, 2,532 recover","Kerala recorded 3,215 new COVID-19 cases and 2,532 recoveries on Tuesday. Of Tuesday's cases, 3,013 contracted the disease through contact. Among them, the source of infection of 313 is yet to be traced, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said during his evening briefing. There are 89 health workers among the newly infected: 31 from Kannur, 23 from Thiruvananthapuram, 8 from Malappuram, 7 from Ernakulam, 6 from Pathanamthitta, 5 from Thrissur, 4 from Kasaragod, 3 from Palakkad, and one each from Alappuzha and Wayanad. Twelve deaths were confirmed in the state due to the disease taking the official toll to 466. Forty-three of the newly-infected came from abroad while 70 came from other states. The state has reported 114,033 COVID-19 cases so far, out of which 82,345 persons recovered. The remaining 31,156 patients are being treated in various hospitals. Key points from the CM's press meet: • Coronavirus pandemic has invited comparisons with 1918's Spanish Flu. It had 50 crore infected, 5 crore deaths. Despite our scientific advances, COVID has infected 3 crore and resulted in 10 lakh deaths. In India alone, 50 lakhs infected and 80,000 died. • We will overcome COVID just like we overcame Spanish flu. It's no doubt a test of humanity, against an unseen enemy. We should not let our negligence falter our steps in this fight. The threats are very real. • On Tuesday, 5901 incidents of people not wearing masks were reported in the state. • Also disheartening is how few factions are spreading false information regarding the ineffectiveness of precautionary measures designed to curb coronavirus. This registration is a dangerous predicament, one that can result in severe consequences. • If you look at the data from the last few weeks, it is evident that contact cases form the largest contributor to daily COVID spikes. • We must not let our guard now. Not now. Not ever. The idea that our measures are ineffective must be discarded. They have been effective in curbing COVID threat in the state to a large extent. • The credit goes to the restraint of the people of our state, their consideration, and of course, the efforts of our health personnel. • New waves of COVID are imminent in Europe and elsewhere, study reveals. We have been able to restrict such an occurrence in the State so far. Our efforts will be ramped up in coming days to curb the virus further. As mentioned earlier, daily tests will be increased to 50K. • This ""protest"" outside the Secretariat in these days of COVID crisis is a concern. It is in violation of the directives issued by the Health Department. We welcome the High Court's intervention in this matter. Yet, these protests continue - without masks, not heeding social distance and in complete disregard of COVID rules. It is disrupting the peace in the state. It cannot be allowed. It's Kerala govt's responsibility - no matter what party is at the helm - to see it to an end, immediately, the CM said. • The fact that leaders who represent the people too are among the protests is also another matter of concern. It is reinforcing the idea that COVID measures are needless. He added. • Volunteers have been instrumental in aiding the state in its efforts to curb coronavirus. CM urged more youngsters to come forward. The state will welcome the efforts of our youngsters. They will play a big role in our fight against coronavirus. Here's the district-wise break-up of today's cases: Thiruvananthapuram - 656 (626 contact cases)

2020-09-15,17:13:22,Onmanorama Staff,Statewide agitations demanding Jaleel's resignation turn street fights with police in many places,"For the fourth day in a row, the youth wings of various political outfits continued their mass agitations in various parts of the state demanding the resignation of higher education minister K T Jaleel. In Kannur, BJP's youth outfit Yuva Morcha took out a march to industries minister's E P Jayarajn's house in Pappinessery demanding that he step down for attempting to destroy evidence of his son's involvement in gold smuggling. The marches turned violent in many places. The Youth Congress march in front of Secretariat demanding Jaleel's ouster turned violent with the police hurling grenades, firing tear gas shells and bludgeoning protesters with batons. Youth Congress president Shafi Parambil and vice president K Sabrinathan, both MLAs, were reportedly injured in the lathi charge. Yuva Morcha and Social Democrtic Prty of India (SDPI) followers also took out marches to the Secretariat on Tuesday. The SDPI activists burnt Jaleel in effigy in front of the Secretariat. In both the cases, the police had to exert force. The marches taken out by BJP's youth outfit Yuva Morcha and another sister outfit, Mahila Morcha, in Kollam also caused the police to employ high-speed water cannons. The march that Yuva Morcha took to the Palakkad Collectorate, too, culminated in the police using force to keep the agitators in control. Mahila Morcha took out a march in Ernakulam, to Kanayannoor taluk office. When women activists attempted to push down the police barricade, water cannon was used to push them back. Muslim Students Federation, the student wing of Indian Union Muslim League, took out a march to Alappuzha Collectorate. Protest marches were held before Wayanad Collectorate also on the day. On September 14, while talking to the media, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the opposition was taking street protests to crude and dangerous levels. He said a car was pushed before the convoy of K T Jaleel near Paripally junction in Kollam. ""When the convoy slowed down, Yuva Morcha protesters jumped in front of the vehicle. Such a dangerous method of putting a car across the national highway cannot be called a protest,"" he said. Vijayan also said the Congress was resorting to obscenities and perverse actions to take on Kunnthur MLA Kovoor Kunjumon. However, when he was asked about a CPM worker throwing a stone at Chief Minister Oommen Chandy during the UDF tenure, he swatted aside the question. ""We need to think about things that are happening at the moment,"" he said.",Manorama,https://www.onmanorama.com/news/kerala/2020/09/15/agitations-demanding-jaleel-resignation-turn-street-fights.html
2020-09-15,20:48:23,PTI,Booker Prize shortlist: Indian-origin US writer Avni Doshi's novel in,"London: Dubai-based Indian-origin author Avni Doshi is among the six authors shortlisted for the 2020 Booker Prize for her debut novel Burnt Sugar'. The shortlist was unveiled virtually in London on Tuesday after judges re-evaluated the 13 longlisted novels published in the UK or Ireland between October 2019 and September 2020 to whittle down the shortlist for the GBP 50,000 literary prize in November. This utterly compelling read examines a complex and unusual mother-daughter relationship with honest, unflinching realism sometimes emotionally wrenching but also cathartic, written with poignancy and memorability, the judges said of Doshi's entry. Doshi, born in the US and now living in Dubai, has previously spoken about the long journey to her first novel, which was released in India last year as Girl in White Cotton' and for its UK release in July. The rest of the shortlist includes Diane Cook for The New Wilderness', Zimbabwean writer Tsitsi Dangarembga for the third novel in her trilogy This Mournable Body', Maaza Mengiste for The Shadow King', Douglas Stuart for Shuggie Bain' and Brandon Taylor for Real Life'. Literary heavyweight and former double Booker winner Hilary Mantel, in the running for her final instalment in her series set in King Henry VIII's 16th century England 'The Mirror and the Light', failed to make the shortlist cut. The shortlist of six came together unexpectedly, voices and characters resonating with us all even when very different. We are delighted to help disseminate these chronicles of creative humanity to a global audience, said Margaret Busby, literary critic and chair of the 2020 judges. As judges, we read 162 books, many of them conveying important, sometimes uncannily similar and prescient messages,"" she said. ""The best novels often prepare our societies for valuable conversations, and not just about the inequities and dilemmas of the world - whether in connection with climate change, forgotten communities, old age, racism, or revolution when necessary - but also about how magnificent the interior life of the mind, imagination and spirit is, in spite of circumstance, she said. The organisers said that readers of the chosen books will travel to India to unpick an unsettling mother-daughter relationship redefined by dementia with Doshi's entry; explore the tender story of a mother's battle to save her daughter in a dystopian city made inhospitable by the climate crisis; witness a woman confronting the realities of life and morality in Zimbabwe as she descends into poverty. They will uncover the extraordinary tales of the African women who went to war during Italy's 1935 invasion of Ethiopia; find humanity and humour in the harsh realities experienced by a marginalised family in 1980s Glasgow; and question what real life' is in a fresh take on the campus novel, which offers a nuanced account of racism and homophobia. Gaby Wood, Literary Director of the Booker Prize Foundation, said: Every year, judging the Booker Prize is an act of discovery. What's out there, how can we widen the net, how do these books seem when compared to one another, how do they fare when re-read? These are questions judges always ask themselves, and each other. This year there has perhaps been more discovery than usual, both in the sense that debut novels are in the majority, and due to the fact that the judges themselves were surprised to find that was the case. Why were they surprised? They were focussing on the books,"" she said. ""No one wins the Booker Prize because of who they are. A book wins because of what it does. What has transpired is a testament to the judges' faith in among other things first fictions: they have found these writers to have much to say, and found them to have said it in a way that became even richer on a second reading. The Booker Prize for Fiction is open to writers of any nationality, writing in English and published in the UK or Ireland. The shortlist of six books will be announced on September 15, with each shortlisted authors receiving 2,500 pounds and a specially bound edition of their book at the prize ceremony scheduled for November. The 2019 Booker Prize for Fiction was won jointly by The Testaments' by Margaret Atwood and Girl, Woman, Other' by Bernardine Evaristo. First awarded in 1969, the Booker Prize is recognised as the leading prize for literary fiction written in English. The rules of the prize were changed at the end of 2013 to embrace the English language ""in all its vigour, its vitality, its versatility and its glory"", opening it up to writers beyond the UK and Commonwealth, providing they were writing novels in English and published in the UK.

2020-09-15,15:46:07,Onmanorama Staff,Court to consider plea to cancel Dileep’s bail in actress assault case on Friday,"Kochi: A special court will consider on Friday a plea by the prosecution seeking to cancel the bail of actor Dileep in the actress assault case. The prosecution had moved the petition pointing out that the actor, through a lawyer, had tried to influence the main witness in the case. The court is also expected to examine actor Mukesh. Other film personalities Siddique and Bhama are likely to appear before the court this week. According to the prosecution, several witnesses who had earlier testified against Dileep, who is one among the prime accused, have changed their statements before the court. Subsequently, the main witness also shifted the stand. The prosecution’s plea says that a lawyer based in Thrissur had tried to influence a witness who had given a statement that he had seen Dileep meeting Pulsar Suni, another accused in the case, at Tennis Club in the town. Considering the prosecution’s suggestion that the lawyer’s action amounted to violation of Dileep’s bail conditions, the special court summoned the lawyer. The court had earlier cancelled the bail of Sunil Kumar, the ninth accused, after he failed to appear before it despite repeated summons. The actress was assaulted on February 18, 2017 and Dileep was arrested on July 17 that year. Dileep, who spent 85 days in jail, was released on bail with stringent conditions by the Kerala High Court.",Manorama,https://www.onmanorama.com/news/kerala/2020/09/15/dileep-bail-actress-assault-case-court-plea.html
2020-09-15,16:29:26,PTI,Jaya Bachchan comes to Bollywood's defense after biting remarks from few 'bad apples',"Veteran actor and Rajya Sabha MP Jaya Bachchan on Tuesday charged that the film industry was being defamed and slammed those from the entertainment industry indulging in it, saying they are biting the hands that feed them.

Though Bachchan did not take any names, her remarks come a day after BJP's Lok Sabha MP and Bhojpuri actor Ravi Kishan said there was problem of drug addiction in the film industry and also actor Kangana Ranaut's recent remarks calling Bollywood a 'gutter'.

Through a Zero Hour mention in Rajya Sabha, Bachchan said the entertainment industry was being flogged by social media and asked the government to protect and support it.

Without taking names, the Samajwadi Party MP said she completely disagrees with those who called the entertainment industry a ""gutter"".

 People in the entertainment industry are being flogged by social media. People who made their names in the industry have called it a gutter. I completely disagree. I hope that govt tells such people not to use this kind of language: MP Jaya Bachchan in Rajya Sabha pic.twitter.com/3OkeUrXnqP ""People who have made a name in this industry have called it a gutter. I completely disagree and I really disassociate,"" she said.

In a reference to Kishan's statement in Lok Sabha on the alleged Bollywood drug cartel, Bachchan said she was ""really embarrassed and ashamed.""

""Jis thali mein khate hai Usme chhed karte hai. Galat baat hai,"" she said referring to a popular Hindi proverb that means to bite the hands that feed you.

""I was really embarrassed and ashamed that yesterday (September 14) one of our members in the Lok Sabha, who is from the industry, spoke. I am not taking names. It is a shame,"" she said.

She said the entertainment industry in the country provides direct employment to 5 lakh people daily and indirect employment to 5 million people.

""At a time when the financial situation is in a depressing state and employment rate at the worst levels, in order to divert the attention of people, we are being flogged by social media"" and there is no support from the government, she said.

Bachchan said the government should come forward and support the entertainment industry.

""I hope the government tells these people who have made their earning, name and fame in this industry to stop using such language,"" she said.

""There are people in the entertainment industry who are some of the highest taxpayers (in the country). They are still being harassed,"" she said.

The government, she said, must stand by the entertainment industry.

""I think the government must stand by the entertainment industry because it always comes forward to help the government in whatever good work it takes up. They come and speak for them, they support them. If there is a national calamity, they come forward, they give money and their services,"" she said.

""I think it is very very important that the government must support this industry and not kill it. Just because there are few people, you cannot tarnish the image of the entire industry,"" she said, adding the industry brings international name and recognition besides a base for political ambitions.

She went on to say that all kinds of promises are made to the entertainment industry but it has never got its due.

""Sir, I get very worked up and very emotional. I have too many things to say but you are not giving me enough time and opportunity,"" she told Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu.

""I need protection, the industry needs the protection and support of the government,"" she added.",Manorama,https://www.onmanorama.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/2020/09/15/jaya-bachchan-slams-kangana-ravi-kishan-biting-hands-that-feeds-them.html

Surendran has lost his mind and is saying things according to his whims and fancies. Pinarayi Vijayan was responding to questions regarding the BJP leader’s statement that more evidence regarding the gold smuggling case will come out if the CM’s daughter was questioned. “He thinks about something all of a sudden and says it out loud. I am not the person to respond to such outbursts. I have more things to tell him but that cannot happen at a press conference. I am not Surendran,” said the CM. The state president of a party is making baseless allegations. BJP must think if such a person should continue as its state chief, Pinarayi Vijayan said. “It has come to a point where he is saying things according to his whims and fancies. In politics, there are certain etiquettes that must be followed. Is he following them? Surendran must explain on what basis he is making such allegations,” the CM demanded. “They are spreading rumours about us and are even dragging our family members into it. But such actions will not bother us. The public is viewing this. They can understand what their motives are. Efforts to mislead will not work here,” Pindarayi Vijayan added. The CM added that efforts are being made to tarnish the image of the LDF government which is free from corruption.

2020-09-16,09:02:00,Ratheesh Ravi,Kerala likely to get 3 special trains soon,"Kollam: Kerala is likely to get three special trains to Chennai and Delhi soon. It is reported that the official order regarding this will be released soon. Thiruvananthapuram - Delhi Kerala express, Thiruvananthapuram - Chennai and Mangalore - Chennai will be the new trains. The service of the new trains may start next week. There were complaints that when 86 new trains were allotted in the country, Kerala was not even allowed one train. The decision to cancel the Jan Shatabdi and Venad Express in the state was also controversial. Although this decision was reversed later, no new trains were alloted to the state. Railways stated that new trains will be allotted if there is more than 25 percent of passengers in the state. Railways also stated that more number of stops will be increased for the trains, if the state demands it. Meanwhile, many trains are running without adequate passenegrs in Kerala. But, in states like Tamil Nadu, the reservation status of passengers, other than in AC compartments, goes to the waiting. Discussions have been held with the General Manager of Southern Railways to allot more trains in the state. He assured that 3 trains will be started by next week in Kerala. The number of passengers are low in Kerala as there are limited stops in special trains. More stops can be allowed if health workers are deployed in more stations. The government has to take care of this, said PK Krishnadas, Chairman of Passenger Amenities Committee.

2020-09-16,08:17:00,,"T'puram airport can only be handed over to Adani group, states central government","Kochi: Central government stated that the bidding process of Thiruvananthapuram airport was done in a transparent manner and that no more relaxations can be granted in this regard as it would affect the bidding procedures. The airport can only be handed over to the Adani group now, the central government stated. It was KSIDC which took part in the bidding process for the state government. When KSIDC offered a bid of Rs135 per passenger, Adani group offered Rs 168 per passenger. This was 19.64 percent more than KSIDC’s bid. KSIDC would have been eligible for special consideration, only if the difference was less than 10 percent. Adani group will sign the contract in 45 days if they receive the national security clearance. The takeover will also be based on the verdict in the case which is under the consideration of the High Court. The airport will be given on lease for 50 years. The money secured through leasing of airports will be used to run the airports which are operated at a loss. The handing over of the airport will be based on the Airport Authority of India Act. The affidavit submitted by the undersecretary of the Ministry of Civil Aviation mentions that the privatisation of the airport was a policy decision. Decision against public interest, states Kerala In the counter affidavit filed by the state government, it was mentioned that handing over the airport to Adani group was against the public interest. It is against the Airport Authority of India Act. Thiruvananthapuram airport is run at a profit and leasing it for the sake of generating income is not acceptable. The state also argued that the airport can only be leased to a company that is valued at more than Rs 1000 crores. Adani group has taken part in the bidding of 6 airports in the country and so airports should be handed over only if the company is worth more tax Rs 6000 crores. Also, the company does not have any prior experience in running airports. The state is ready to take over the Thiruvananthapuram airport. The government should be given special consideration on this issue. The affidavit also mentioned that the assembly passed a resolution in this regard. Meanwhile, the division bench including Justice Vinod Chandran and Justice TR Ravi, has withdrawn from the hearing of the state government's petition against the handing over of the airport. This was because one of the lawyers who appeared in the case was senior to Justice TR Ravi. The petition will now be presented before another bench.
